##Introduction
For using the R script, 'run_analysis.R', contained in this Repo you must follow this brief introduction:
* Download and unpack the dataset (links in the CodeBook).
* Put in the working directory the .txt files specified in the CodeBook.
* The script will load the data and will do the folowing: 
    * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
    * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    * Create a .csv file named 'write.csv' in your working folder, with the results of the script

Enjoy!
